# ðŸ“š Full-Stack Choose Your Own Adventure ML App

A modern, full-stack project utilizing **FastAPI** for a powerful backend and **React** for a dynamic, interactive frontend to create a **Choose Your Own Adventure (CYOA)** game. This application is designed as a focused learning exercise to master asynchronous Python web development and modern component-based frontend frameworks.

## âœ¨ Key Features & Learning Objectives

This project is a deep dive into building a robust API-driven application, demonstrating proficiency in the following areas:

* **FastAPI Backend (API & Logic):**
    * **Asynchronous API Design:** Creating high-performance, async endpoints for managing game state, story progression, and user data.
    * **Pydantic Validation:** Defining robust data models for story nodes, choices, and user sessions.
    * **Database Integration:** Utilizing an **ORM** (e.g., SQLAlchemy) to persist the story structure and player progress.

* **React Frontend (UI & Interaction):**
    * **Component-Based Architecture:** Building reusable components for the story text, choice buttons, and game inventory/stats.
    * **State Management:** Handling complex application state (e.g., current story node, player inventory) using **React Hooks**.
    * **Seamless API Consumption:** Interfacing smoothly with the FastAPI backend to deliver a fluid user experience.

* **"ML" Component (Future Scope):**
    * Integrating a basic **machine learning** or **natural language processing (NLP)** element (e.g., sentiment analysis on user input or dynamic descriptive text generation) as an advanced learning goal.
